# Quiz-Generator
Note: This project was made as the final project of Scrimba's React Course with a figma design file as the only used guideline of the project.

This app is a quiz generator that uses opentdb.com's quiz question api to generate 5 random questions that the user can answer and features a check answer button to check the user's answers and a play again button to comeplete a new quiz. The purpose of this application was to further my knowledge of React and strengthen my knowledge of fundamental concepts such as gathering API data, using React State, and using React Effect.
